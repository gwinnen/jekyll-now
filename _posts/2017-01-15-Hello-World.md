# Energyfluidics™ Bodywork
Energyfluidics™ - is the method created by Steven Hurwitz to raise creative life forces in order to cultivate a divine union experience within an awareness of stillness. The inner quiet, along with specific energetic movements and individual meditations furthers inner joy, equanimity and peace. It is a spiritual path that is grounded in selfless service to relieve the suffering of others while pursuing the unfolding and outward manifestation of individual enlightenment. Understanding how our actions, words, and thoughts interact with all sentient beings, we learn to act out of the stillness of the body, the silence of speech, and the spacious awareness of mind. We learn how to remove the clouds that obscure the eternal values of love, joy and compassion and equanimity. Wisdom is gained and one’s own destiny begins its conscious unfolding. <br/>
Inner freedom requires change from the constant noise of the agitated mind. When physical blockages and mental unrest are released through the energy and deep tissue movement, the wisdom winds and renewed life forces renew its energetic strength. Energyfluidics™ releases the cause of pain found in the body’s interstitial fluids. Fascia (a type of connective tissue) holds tension and pain in the muscles, and once cleared, allows a return to homeostasis, permitting both acute and chronic muscle tension to relax, often permanently. The muscular skeletal system becomes more balanced and stabilized, tensions and pain are reduced or eliminated, and the mental state becomes more focused. Clients report a feeling of lightness, courage, peacefulness, freedom in their ability to cry, deep relaxation...plus a host of physical corrections. <br/>
Addressing the need to correct a disturbed equilibrium, Steven works physically with his hands near and on the surface of the of the skin, with varying degrees of pressure, and on the fluid body permeating facia and muscle. Healing and defense mast cells release bio-molecules needed for homeostasis, immune surveillance, wound healing and tissue repair. Energyfluidics™ treatments help free the body's energetic levels in meridians and muscles. <br/>
It is possible to permanently heal through this energy. Great healers know this energy. No one can take ownership of this energy, yet we all can have access to it. Steven’s mission is to incarnate this healing treatment of pain and compromised health. Those that receive his treatment and counsel can regain the course of their life.

Therapies directed to the primary elements of the body: hardness, softness, temperature, fluidity and movement within the body.

3. Consciousness and Mind-States

4. Speech
